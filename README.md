# Tanishq Harit | Digital Garden

This repository contains the source code and Markdown notes for my digital garden and portfolio, hosted automatically via GitHub Pages.

## Managing Content

To add or edit content on the website:
1. Navigate to the `docs/` folder.
2. Create or modify `.md` (Markdown) files.
3. Commit and push the changes to the `main` branch.

A GitHub Actions workflow will automatically rebuild the site and deploy the changes live.

## Local Development

To preview changes locally before pushing:

```bash
npm install
npm run start
```

This will run a local development server at `http://localhost:3000/Portfolio/` where you can see edits applied instantly.
