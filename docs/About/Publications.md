### Face Recognition Based Anti-Theft Car System Using Arduino Uno
**Journal of Emerging Technologies and Innovative Research (Journal Vol. 11, Issue 5)** · *May 8, 2024*

Achieved 99.38% facial recognition accuracy on industry-standard benchmark using Haar Cascade + LBPH algorithms, enabling reliable biometric authentication for vehicle access control and preventing unauthorized entry. Engineered low-cost Arduino Uno-based IoT security prototype with automated email alert system and engine immobilization, providing real-time threat notifications to vehicle owners during unauthorized access attempts. Integrated biometric authentication with hardware components (L298N motor driver, DC motors) for scalable, low-cost anti-theft solution.
