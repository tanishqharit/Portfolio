# About Me

I'm a Computer Science grad student at Stevens Institute of Technology, graduating in May 2026, and I'm actively looking for full-time opportunities in data science, data analytics, or data engineering.

I got into this field because I love the challenge of turning messy data into something meaningful—finding patterns, uncovering insights, and building solutions that make a real impact.

Most recently, I interned at Alcor Technical Solutions where I built an AI-powered document search system that cut search time from 30 minutes to just 5 seconds, saving the team 20 hours every week. Before that, I worked at India's Defense Research Organization developing secure communication systems, and at LTIMindtree testing platforms used by over 135 million taxpayers.

I also co-authored a research paper on face recognition systems that achieved 99.38% face recognition accuracy, published in May 2024.

I work primarily with Python, SQL, and tools like Tableau and Power BI, and I've gotten hands-on experience with machine learning, NLP, data pipelines, and building full-stack applications. Beyond the technical stuff, I'm someone who enjoys collaborating with teams, learning new technologies, and taking on challenges that push me to grow.

I'm based in the NY/NJ area and would love to connect if you're hiring or just want to chat about data, tech, or opportunities.
